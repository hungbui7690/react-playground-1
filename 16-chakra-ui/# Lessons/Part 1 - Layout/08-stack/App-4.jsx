/*
  Stack items horizontally
  - Pass the direction and set it to row. Optionally, you can use align and justify to adjust the alignment and distribution of the items.

  ðŸŒ¿ Notes on Stack vs Flex#
  - The Stack component and the Flex component have their children spaced out evenly but the key difference is that the Stack won't span the entire width of the container whereas the Flex will. Another thing to note is that the items in both Stack and Flex are aligned in the center by default.
